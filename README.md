### Thoughts

Working again with plain HTML, CSS and JS felt kind of weird. It definitely makes the developer appreciate the frameworks :D Nevertheless it was fun and a very nostalgic experience!

_BTW - sorry if the implementation isn't pixel perfect with the figma desing - I was unable to see the styles properties but I think it looks pretty good anyways ;D_
